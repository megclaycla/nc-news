How to create the environment variables to clone this project and run it locally:

- You will need to create two .env files for your project: .env.test and .env.development
- Into each, add PGDATABASE=, with the correct database name for that environment (see /db/setup.sql for the database names)
- Double check that these .env files are .gitignored.
